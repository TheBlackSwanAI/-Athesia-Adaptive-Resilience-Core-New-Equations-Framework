## Athesia Adaptive Resilience Core – New Equations Framework (Cross-Domain Extensions)

The new equations framework extends the original Athesia Adaptive Resilience Core using only public-domain, non-patented scientific principles (classical physics, control theory, chemistry, ecology/mathematics) to illustrate broader resilience and self-healing applications.

- **Damped Harmonic Oscillator** (physics)  
  \(\ddot{x} + 2\zeta\omega_n \dot{x} + \omega_n^2 x = 0\)  
  → Maps to recovery budget dynamics; ζ acts as resilience damping rate after exceedance.

- **Sigmoid-Gated PID** (control theory)  
  \(u(t) = G(B) \cdot (K_p E(t) + K_i \int_0^t E(s)\,ds + K_d \dot{E}(t))\)  
  → Extends Athesia's authority gating; sigmoid \(G(B)\) throttles corrections under low resilience budget.

- **Le Chatelier Rate Dynamics** (chemistry)  
  \(\frac{d[A]}{dt} = k_f [A] - k_r [B]\)  
  → Analog for equilibrium-based damage mitigation and recovery inflow/outflow balance.

- **Lotka-Volterra Mode Competition** (ecology/mathematics)  
  \(\dot{x} = \alpha x - \beta x y\)  
  \(\dot{y} = \delta x y - \gamma y\)  
  → Demonstrates dynamic mode blending/switching under cumulative stress or drift.
